# VulnSight — A Web Vulnerability Scanner

**Detect. Analyze. Defend.**

A full-stack, real-time security intelligence platform for discovering XSS vulnerabilities,
auditing source code for critical anti-patterns, and tracking live CVE threat feeds —
all inside a sleek, dark-mode-ready dashboard.

---

</div>

---

## Overview

VulnSight is a professional-grade web security platform built with Python and Streamlit. It combines an automated XSS scanning engine, a static source-code analyzer, a real-time CVE intelligence feed, and a full analytics dashboard into a single deployable application.

Designed for security researchers, developers, and penetration testers, VulnSight makes vulnerability discovery fast, visual, and actionable — without requiring any external tooling or complex configuration. It can be spun up locally or deployed as a containerized service in minutes.

---

## Objectives

- Automate the detection of Reflected XSS vulnerabilities across web application forms
- Identify critical security anti-patterns in source code through static regex-based analysis
- Surface the latest CVE disclosures ranked by CVSS severity score
- Provide session-level analytics with severity breakdowns and finding summaries
- Generate exportable HTML vulnerability reports for documentation and client delivery
- Package the entire platform as a containerized, one-command deployment via Docker

## Methodology & Implementation

### 1. Authentication Layer

Session-based login with SHA-256 hashed credentials managed through Streamlit session state. Supports multi-user accounts, logout, and automatic state cleanup on session end.

### 2. XSS Scanning Engine

The scanner crawls a target URL, parses all HTML forms using BeautifulSoup, and systematically injects a wordlist of XSS payloads into every fillable input field. Reflection is verified against both raw and HTML-encoded payload variants to minimize false negatives. SSL errors are handled gracefully with a fallback re-scan.

### 3. Static Code Analyzer

A regex-based rule engine scans pasted source code line-by-line against 12 security rules covering: hardcoded credentials, SQL injection via string concatenation, `eval()` / `exec()` usage, `subprocess shell=True`, insecure deserialization (`pickle`, `yaml.load`), disabled SSL verification, `innerHTML` assignment, `document.write`, debug mode, MD5/SHA-1 usage, and open redirects. Each finding includes the line number, code snippet, and remediation guidance.

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

Session findings are aggregated into metric cards, a severity breakdown bar chart, a finding-type distribution panel, and a paginated results table — all rendered with custom HTML/CSS components inside Streamlit.

### 5. CVE Threat Intelligence Feed

Pulls structured CVE data (ID, description, severity, CVSS score) sorted by criticality. Architecture supports live NVD 2.0 API integration with a mock feed for offline use.

### 6. Report Generation

A Jinja2-powered HTML report renderer produces a fully self-contained, styled vulnerability report with severity summary boxes, a findings table, and XSS-safe output escaping — downloadable directly from the dashboard.

## Conclusion

VulnSight demonstrates that professional-grade security tooling does not require heavyweight frameworks or complex infrastructure. By combining an automated XSS scanner, a static code analyzer, real-time CVE intelligence, and a polished analytics dashboard into a single containerized Python application, the platform delivers genuine security value with minimal setup friction.

The project reinforced core concepts in web security (XSS, SQL injection, insecure deserialization, CSRF), secure coding practices, and the architecture of real-world vulnerability scanning workflows. The modular codebase is designed for extension — swapping the mock CVE feed for a live NVD API, adding CSRF or SQLi scanning modules, or integrating authentication via OAuth are all natural next steps.

VulnSight proves that clarity, design, and security can coexist in a single tool.
